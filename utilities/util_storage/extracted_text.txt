This distinction between empathizing and systemizing (E-S) psychologies, and how it may statistically correlate with gender, may shed light on challenges faced in collective sensemaking and governance efforts. Speaking just from my experience, all of the DAOs I've been a part of have been male by vast majority. Might this have something to do with the prevailing tendency for DAO governance discussion to revolve around game theory, mechanism design, economic incentives, and other systems-oriented epistemologies? As what may be considered an invisible epistemic predisposition, might this highly systematic approach to governance be a yang to the under-established yin of a more empathic approach?

Of course, it is worth noting how the technology industry naturally attracts people who epistemologically skew toward the systematic side, and how this may constitute something of a selection bias baked into the nature of the domain itself. In other words, if technical fields tend to skew toward the neurodivergent, and if the "extreme male brain" hypothesis of autism is accurate, it may help explain why these fields are especially male-dominated. However, this line of inquiry can run the risk of cementing an epistemic gender essentialism into our discourse.

Social coherence in a group is arguably what allows that group to scale its operational efficacy beyond the sum of its parts. Whether or not we take the position of the E-S theory, a substantive part of this coherence is a balanced psychological diversity of the people involved. Where many of the existing governance conversations are dominated by systems-oriented psychologies, perhaps we would benefit from a greater presence of communication-oriented and facilitation-oriented psychologies.
